# How you benefit

With RiftLend, we're aiming to simplify the lending exerience in a multichain world, thanks to Interops on the Optimism Superchain.

We believe that interoperability is the end game of cross-chain communication.&#x20;

It enables this process without any cross-chain contract calls, using events that can be verified in the CrossL2Inbox, ensuring the necessary security guarantees.

As it is natively built into the op-stack, it eliminates current middlemen bridges for cross-chain applications empowering app developers to create complex interaction designs like RiftLend.

With Interop, RiftLend synchronizes reserve states across chains, offering a consistent interest rate for lenders and borrowers, regardless of the underlying chain.

## How are we different?
