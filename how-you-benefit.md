# How you benefit?

With RiftLend, we aim to simplify the lending experience in a multichain world, thanks to Interops on the Optimism Superchain.&#x20;

We believe interoperability is the future of cross-chain communication. It enables seamless processes without any cross-chain contract calls by using events verified in the CrossL2Inbox, ensuring necessary security guarantees.

Natively integrated into the op-stack, it eliminates existing middlemen bridges for cross-chain applications. This empowers app developers to create complex interaction designs like RiftLend.

With Interop, RiftLend synchronizes reserve states across chains, offering consistent interest rates for lenders and borrowers, regardless of the underlying chain.
