# What is RiftLend?

RiftLend is a next-generation lending and borrowing protocol native to the OP Superchain ecosystem. It facilitates seamless cross-chain transactions across all supported L2 networks. By leveraging OP interoperability, the protocol dismantles traditional barriers between chains, unifying liquidity into a single, cohesive landscape.

Built on the battle-tested Aave V2 architecture, RiftLend embraces Superchain paradigms with innovations that eliminate the need for isolated protocol instances across chains. This provides users with a single point of access to a CEX-like experience in a decentralized manner.
