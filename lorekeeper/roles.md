# Roles

There are four Lorekeeper roles, each offering unique ways to engage with and flex within the RiftLend ecosystem. Whether you’re a degen content wizard, a social KOL, or a builder in the trenches, there’s a role for everyone in the Rift.

## 1. Base Lorekeeper (LOREKEEPER B.0.0)

Everyone starts here. You join the Guild? You’re in. But don’t get comfy—this is just the launchpad.

* Multiplier: None. You’re still crawling.
* How to Level Up: Collect points, grind harder, and participate in the Rift!

## 2. Ambassador Lorekeeper (LOREKEEPER A.0.0)

For those who hustle to promote RiftLend. Are you a KOL? A community whisperer? Represent RiftLend and slap on this role.\


* Multiplier: 2.5x points.
* The Job: Spread the Rift gospel. Be the hype machine RiftLend deserves.

## 3. Creative Lorekeeper (LOREKEEPER C.0.0)

For the content fiends out there. Craft technical tweets, unleash degen memes, or create absolute fire that RiftLend reposts.\


* Multiplier: 1.5x points.
* The Job: Bring creativity to the table, get noticed, and gain recognition.

## 4. Dev Lorekeeper (LOREKEEPER D.0.0)

For the code gods. Build, debug, or innovate within the RiftLend ecosystem. This role is exclusive, and the team decides who gets it.\


* Multiplier: 4x points (yep, you read that right).
* The Job: Push the boundaries of RiftLend tech, open-source style.
