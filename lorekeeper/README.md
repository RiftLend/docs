# Lorekeeper

The Lorekeeper Program is not your regular “community rewards scheme.” It’s a gamified, multi-layered system designed for degens who are ready to earn clout, stack multipliers, and flex on the leaderboard. At RiftLend, we’re about building bridges and breaking chains (pun intended) while rewarding those who make this ecosystem a beast. This is where you prove your loyalty, grind points, and climb the ranks from a base pleb to an OG Rifter. The grind is real, but so are the perks.\
