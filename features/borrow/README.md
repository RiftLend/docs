# Borrow

* Borrowers can access liquidity by using collateral deposited on any supported chain.
* They can borrow assets on their preferred chain, regardless of where the collateral is held.
* Borrowing is enabled through unified liquidity pools, which ensure consistent interest rates and reduce volatility across chains.
* Borrowers can toggle between variable and stable interest rates to manage costs effectively.
* Flexible collateral options allow users to enable or disable specific assets as collateral across chains.
