# How to Use Flash Loans

## How to Use Flash Loans

1.  **Initiate the Loan**:

    Trigger a flash loan request from any supported Superchain. Specify the asset and amount you need for the transaction.
2.  **Execute Your Strategy:**

    Use the borrowed funds to perform operations like arbitrage or liquidations within the same transaction.
3.  **Repay the Loan:**

    Repay the full amount (plus the premium) within the same transaction on the lending chain. If repayment conditions are not met, the transaction is reverted.
